## 1.1

Objects in OOP is an *abstraction* mechanism.

An object is an *encapsulation* of some data and related behavior in terms of two aspects:

1. The **packaging** aspect: An object packages data and related behavior together into one self-contained unit.

2. The **information hiding** aspect: The data in an object is hidden from the outside world and are only accessible using the object's interface.

A class contains instructions for creating a specific kind of objects.

Inheritance implies the derived class can be considered as a sub-type of the base class (and the base class is a super-type of the derived class), resulting in an is a relationship.

*Method overloading* is when there are multiple methods with the same name but different type signatures.

**Type Signature**: The type signature of an operation is the type sequence of the parameters. The return type and parameter names are not part of the type signature. However, the parameter order is significant.

*Method overriding* is when a sub-class changes the behavior inherited from the parent class by re-implementing the method. Overridden methods have the same name, same type signature, and same return type.

**Hidden field**: when both the superclass and the subclass use the same variable name, the superclass variables is said to be hidden/shadowed by the subclass variable

A subclass constructor can invoke the superclass constructor. Invocation of a superclass constructor must be the **first line** in the subclass constructor.

# 1.3

Polymorphism allows you to write code targeting superclass objects, use that code on subclass objects, and achieve possibly different results based on the actual class of the object.

A class that has an abstract method becomes an abstract class because the class definition is incomplete (due to the missing method body) and it is not possible to create objects using an incomplete class definition.

In Java, even a class that does not have any abstract methods can be declared as an abstract class.

When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass should provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its superclass or else the subclass must also be declared abstract.

A class implementing an interface results in an is-a relationship, just like in class inheritance.

Every instance of a subclass is an instance of the superclass, but not vice-versa. As a result, inheritance allows substitutability : the ability to substitute a child class object where a parent class object is expected.

Overridden methods are resolved using dynamic binding, and therefore resolves to the implementation in the actual type of the object.

Overloaded methods are resolved using static binding.

Three concepts combine to achieve polymorphism: substitutability, operation overriding, and dynamic binding.

The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. It contains the following:
- Interfaces
- Implementations
- Algorithms

## 1.5

There are three basic categories of exceptions In Java:
- Checked exceptions: exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from.
- Errors: exceptional conditions that are external to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
- Runtime exceptions: conditions that are internal to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.

Errors and runtime exceptions are collectively known as unchecked exceptions.

In Java, Checked exceptions are subject to the Catch or Specify Requirement: code that might throw checked exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:
* A try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception.
* A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception.

Unchecked exceptions are not required to follow to the Catch or Specify Requirement but you can apply the requirement to them too.
