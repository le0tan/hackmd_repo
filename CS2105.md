# Lecture 1: Introduction


## 1.3 Network core

i.e. A mesh of interconnected routers

### Circuit switching

End-to-end resources allocated and **reserved** for "call" between source and destination.

- Require setup
- Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
- No sharing: circuit segment idle if not used by call
- Divide link bandwidth into pieces by
  - frequency division
  - time division

### Packet switching

- Break message into **packets** of length $L$ bits
- transmits packets onto the link at transmission rate $R$
  - transmission rate = link capacity / bandwidth

![](https://i.imgur.com/uxAhepE.png)

**Note:** *transmission rate* = $L / t$ 所以单位是 bits/sec (bps)

Compared with *circuit switching*:

- The Internet is a packet switching network
- User A, B ... ’s packets **share** network resources
- Resources are used on demand
- Excessive congestion is possible (No guaranteed performance)

#### Store-and-forward

i.e. **entire** packet must arrive at a router before it can be transmitted on the next link

#### Routing and Addressing

*Routing algo*: how routers determine source-destination route taken by packets.

*Addressing*: each packet needs to carry source and
destination information


### Internet structure

The Internet is a **“network-of-networks”**, organized into autonomous systems (AS), each is owned by an organization.

## 1.4 Delay, Loss and Throughput in Networks

### Delay

#### Four sources of packet delay

- Processing delay
  - check bit errors
  - determine output link
  - typically < milliseconds
- Queuing delay
  - time waiting in the queue for transmission
  - depends on congestion level of router
- Transmission delay
  - $L$: packet length (bit)
  - $R$: link bandwidth (bps)
  - $D_{trans} = L / R$ (s)
- Propagation delay
  - d: length of physical link (m)
  - s: propagation speed in medium ($\approx2*10^8$ m/s)
  - $d_{prop} = d/s$ (s)

**Note:** *transmission delay* 指的是packet从第一个bit到最后一个bit全部进入link的时间，*propagation delay*指的是每一个bit从source到destination的时间

#### End-to-end packet delay

i.e. the time taken for a packet to travel from source to destination

### Loss

- Queue (aka buffer) of a router has finite capacity.
- Packet arriving to full queue will be dropped (aka lost).
- Lost packet may be
  - re-transmitted by previous node
  - by source host
  - or not at all.

### Throughput

i.e. how many bits can be transmitted per unit time

- measured for **end-to-end** communication (not on a specific link, but the end result of the packet traveling through all the links)
- Link capacity (bandwidth) is meant for a specific link

## 1.5 Protocol Layers and Service Models

### Protocol **layers**

- Protocols in the Internet are logically organized into “layers” according to their purposes.
  - Each layer provides a service
  - Simple interfaces between layers
  - Hide details from each other

### Internet protocol stack

- application
- transport
- network
- link
- physical

# Lecture 2/3: Application Layer

## 2.1 Principles of network applications

* Classic structures
  * Client-server
    * server waits for incoming requests
    * client initiates contact with server
  * Peer-to-peer (P2P)
    * no always-on server
    * self scalability -> new peers = new service capacity = new service demands
* Metrics for a transport service
  * Data integrity
  * Timing
  * Throughput
  * Security
* Application protocols define
  * types of messages
  * message syntax
  * message semantics
  * rules for when and how app sends/responds to messages
* Transport protocols
  * TCP
    * reliable
    * flow control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
    * congestion control: throttle sender when network is overloaded
    * WITHOUT: timing, throughput guarantee, security
  * UDP
    * unreliable
    * WITHOUT: well, everything...

## 2.2 Web and HTTP

### HTTP overview

* Hypertext transfer protocol
  * client-server model
  * uses **TCP** as transport service
  * Two types
    * non-persistent HTTP
      * at most one object sent over one TCP connection
      * connection closed thereafter
      * downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections
    * persistent HTTP

### Response time

**RTT:** (Round trip time) time for a packet to travel from client to server and go back

**HTTP response time:** 
* one RTT -> establish TCP conn
* one RTT -> HTTP request and the first few bytes of HTTP response
* file transmission time

Thus, non-persistent HTTP response time = $2*RTT + T_{File Transmission}$

Solution: parallel TCP connections

### Persistent HTTP

* one RTT for all referenced objects
* server leaves conn open after response
  * subsequent HTTP messages are sent over the same TCP conn
* Persistent with pipelining
  * client may send requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object

### HTTP message

#### Request

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Ivmd82.png)

Format:

![](https://i.imgur.com/GMP71ub.png)

Request method types:

* HTTP/1.0:
  * GET
  * POST
    * web page often includes form input
    * input is uploaded to server in entity body
  * HEAD
    * asks server to leave requested object out of response
* HTTP/1.1:
  * GET, POST, HEAD
  * PUT
    * uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field
  * DELETE
    * deletes file specified in the URL field

##### Conditional `GET`

![](https://i.imgur.com/kormau2.png)


#### Response

![](https://i.imgur.com/1xCyOtR.png)

#### Cookies

Cookies: HTTP messages that carry “state”

Where?

1) cookie header field of HTTP request/ response messages
2) cookie file kept on user’s host, managed by user’s browser
3) back-end database at Web site

![](https://i.imgur.com/9JW2toJ.png)

## 2.4 DNS

Domain name system: Hostname -> IP Address

**DNS run over UDP**

### Resource records (RR)

Mapping between host names and IP addresses (and others) are stored as resource records (RR).

Format: (name, value, type, ttl)

Types:
* A (address)
  * (name -> value)
  * hostname -> IP address
* NS (name server)
  * domain -> hostname of authoritative name server for this domain
* CNAME (canonical name)
  * alias name -> canonical name
* MX (mail exchanger)
  * name -> name of the mail server

### Distributed, hierarchical database of RRs

![](https://i.imgur.com/3n4E9dk.png)

Root servers: Answers requests for records in the root zone by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD).

Top-level domain (TLD) servers: responsible for com, org, net, edu, … and all top-level country domains, e.g., uk, sg, jp

Authoritative servers: Organization’s own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization’s named hosts (e.g. Web, mail)

#### Local DNS servers

#### DNS caching

Once a name server learns mapping, it cachesmapping.
* cached entries may be out-of-date
* cached entries expire after some time (TTL)
* if name host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire

#### DNS name resolution

* Recursive
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/q53czXg.png)
* Iterative
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/W9Q70y4.png)

## 2.7 Socket programming

* Applications (or processes) treat the Internet as a black box, sending and receiving messages through sockets.
* Two types of sockets
  * TCP: reliable, byte stream-oriented socket
  * UDP: unreliable datagram socket

# Lecture 4&5: The transport layer

## 3.1 Transport layer services

Different names for packets:
* Application layer: message
* Transport layer (process-to-process communication): segments
  * contains source and dest **port numbers**
* Network layer (host-to-host, best effort, unreliable communication): datagram
  * each IP datagram contains source and dest **IP addresses**
  * ~ contains one transport-layer segment

![](https://i.imgur.com/nU3PikP.png)

## UDP: connectionless transport

* On top of IP, UDP adds
  * connectionless multiplexing / de-multiplexing
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/HMcTfyB.png)
    * IP datagrams (from different sources) with the same destination port # will be directed to the same UDP socket at destination. (i.e. 接收信息的端口也会是应答同一条信息的端口)
  * checksum
    * sender computes the checksum and put the value into the header
    * receiver computes the checksum and compares it against the header's value
    * How to compute?
      * 1. Treat UDP segment as a sequence of 16-bit integers.
      * 2. Apply binary addition on every 16-bit integer(checksum field is currently 0).
      * 3. Carry (if any) from the most significant bit will be added to the result.
      * 4. Compute 1’s complement to get UDP checksum.
* UDP transmission is **unreliable**
  * reliable transmission over UDP can be implemented by applications
    * but with error detection and recovery mechanism of their own

## 3.4 Principles of reliable data transfer

Unreliable network may
* corrupt packets
* drop packets
* deliver packets after an arbitrarily long delay (i.e. may result in repeated packets if re-sent)

Reliable transport should
* guarantee packet delivery and correctness
* deliver packets in the same order

Reliable data transfer (RDT): service model

![](https://i.imgur.com/qs5JWSt.png)

(The transport layer does all the dirty work. The application layer doesn't perceive anything.)

### rdt 1.0: perfectly reliable channel

### rdt 2.0: channel with bit errors


* Stop and wait protocol
  * Sender sends one packet at a time, then waits for receiver response
  * Acknowledgements (**ACK**s):receiver explicitly tells sender that packet received is OK.
  * Negative acknowledgements (**NAK**s):receiver explicitly tells sender that packet has errors.

In rdt 2.0, sender retransmits packet on receipt of NAK, transmits the next packet on receipt of ACK:

![](https://i.imgur.com/BHJDRqB.png)

### rdt (to be finished)

### Performance of rdt 3.0

#### Stop-and-wait: low utilization & throughput

Let the packet size be $L$ bits, link rate (transmission rate) be $R$ bps, RTT be $RTT$ s

* Sender takes $L/R + RTT$ s to send a packet
* Thus the throughput is $\frac{L}{RTT + D_{trans}} = \frac{L}{RTT + \frac{L}{R}}$

![](https://i.imgur.com/ihVFukO.png)

Utilization is low: $U_{Sender} = \frac{L/R}{RTT+L/R}$, and $RTT$ (propagation delay) is higher than transmission delay.

#### Pipelining: increase utilization

* Pipelining: sender allows multiple, “in-flight”, yet-to-be-acknowledged packets.
  * range of sequence numbers must be increased (for n-packet pipelining, n sequence numbers are needed)
  * buffering at sender and/or receiver

![](https://i.imgur.com/mZua2Zu.png)

**Assumption:** (same as rdt 3.0)

* may flip bits in packets
* may lose packets
* may incur arbitrarily long packet delay
* but **won’t re-order packets**

Two generic forms of pipelined protocols:

* Go-Back-N (GBN)
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/qSuQPDn.png)
  * Sender
    * allow up to $N$ unACKed packets on the fly
    * insert k-bit sequence number in packet header
    * ignore duplicate ACK
    * use a *sliding window* to keep track of unACKed packets
      * keep a timer for oldest unACKed packet
      * on timeout for packet $x$, re-transmit packets from $x$ to $x+N-1$
        * i.e. *slide* the window after the oldest ACKed packet
  * Receiver
      * only ACK packets that arrive in order
        * *Cumulative ACK*: ACK $m$ means all packets up to packet $m$ are received
        * Nice: ![](https://i.imgur.com/KqgHKfI.png)
        * Bad: ![](https://i.imgur.com/kLBBAtc.png)
      * discard out-of-order packets and ACK the last in-order packet
* Selective repeat (SR)
  * Receiver *individually acknowledges* all correctly received packets.
    * **Buffers** out-of-order packets, as needed, for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer.
  * Sender maintains a timer for **every** unACKed packet
    * only re-transmit unACKed packet


## 3.5 TCP (**T**ransport **C**ontrol **P**rotocol)

### Connection-oriented de-mux

* A TCP connection (socket) is identified by 4-tuple:
    * `(srcIPAddr, srcPort, destIPAddr, destPort)`
* Receiver uses all four values to direct a segment to the appropriate socket.

### TCP header

![](https://i.imgur.com/Iomy57s.png)

* `A`: 0 means data packet (data given in the body), 1 means ACK packet (ACK number given in the header)
    * *Piggyback*: includes ACK# in a data packet
        * useful in bi-directional communication
        * note that both TCP and UDP are **full duplex protocol** (i.e. bi-directional data flow in the same connection)

### TCP sequence number

**Definition:** *byte number* of the first byte of data in a segment

![](https://i.imgur.com/j0S4fZz.png)

Seq. # of 
* 1stTCP segment: 0
* 2ndTCP segment: 1,000
* 3rdTCP segment: 2,000
* 4thTCP segment: 3,000
* etc.

More on TCP seq #:
* Initial seq # is randomly chosen
* Initial seq # is an offset applied by every packet
* Each party independently choose the initial seq #
    * sender decides the init seq #
    * for bi-directional communication, two init seq # exist

### TCP ACK number

**Definition:** seq# of the next byte of data *expected* by receiver

* TCP ACKs up to the *first* missing byte in the stream (**cumulative ACK**)
* TCP spec doesn't say how receiver handle out-of-order segments (can buffer or throw away, it depends)

### TCP sender events

![](https://i.imgur.com/6ztsbv2.png)

*Send base:* the first unACKed packet, because TCP ACK is cumulative, if ACK n is greater than `send base`, it's safe to advance `send base` after `n`

### TCP receiver events

![](https://i.imgur.com/hNXxMAZ.png)

### TCP timeout value

* Choosing a proper timeout value is important
    * too short: premature timeout -> unnecessary retransmission
    * too long: slow reaction to lost segment
    * timeout must be longer than RTT, but not too long
        * but RTT varies
* TCP computes *timeout interval* based on *estimated RTT*
    * $RTT_{Estimated} = (1-\alpha) * RTT_{Estimated} + \alpha * RTT_{Sample}$
        * $\alpha_{typical} = 0.125$
    * $RTT_{Deviation} = (1-\beta) * RTT_{Deviation} + \beta * \lvert RTT_{Sample} - RTT_{Estimated} \rvert$
        * $\beta_{typical} = 0.25$
    * $TimeoutInterval = RTT_{Estimated} + 4 * RTT_{Deviation}$
    * $+ 4 * RTT_{Deviation}$ is the *safety margin*


### TCP fast retransmission

* Event: sender receives **3 duplicate ACKs** for the same data
    * it assumes the segment after that ACK is lost
* Action: resend segment, even before the timer expires

### TCP establishing connection

![](https://i.imgur.com/l4jbx6P.png)

* 3-way handshake
    * first two packets - no application data allowed


### TCP tearing down connection

* Client, server each close their side of connection.
    * send TCP segment with FIN bit = 1

# Lecture 6&7: The network layer

## Overview of the network layer

![](https://i.imgur.com/BmQv0xw.png)

## DHCP

stands for *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol*

### Usage

  * allows a host to dynamically obtain its IP address from *DHCP server* when it joins network
  * IP address is renewable
  * allows reuse of addresses
  * supports mobile users to join the network

### 4-step process of DHCP

1. Host broadcasts *DHCP discover* message
2. DHCP server responds with *DHCP offer* message
3. Host requests IP address with *DHCP request* message
4. DHCP server confirms IP address with *DHCP ACK* message

![](https://i.imgur.com/ryq1IZg.png)

* Except for IP address assignment, DHCP server may also provide
  * IP address of *first-hop router*
  * IP address of local DNS server
  * Network mask
* DHCP runs over UDP
  * server port: 67
  * client port: 68
* Special IP addresses
  * `0.0.0.0/8`: non-routable
  * `127.0.0.0/8`: loopback address
  * `255.255.255.255/32`: broadcast address (all hosts on the same *subnet* receives a datagram with such a dest addr)
  * more on page 11 of lecture notes 6&7

## Internet Protocol (IP)

### IP address

* IP address is used to identify a host (or a router)
  * a 32-bit integer
  * associated with a *network interface*
    * a network card on a host
    * a port on a router
  * logically comprises of two parts
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/AGTY0e8.png)
    * *Subnet* is a network formed by a group of **directly interconnected** hosts
      * in the same subnet <-> have the same network prefix
      * within the same subnet = reach each other without router
      * connect to the outside through a router

### IPv4 datagram format

* IP header: **20 bytes**
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/SiLmDFT.png)

### IPv4 datagram fragmentation

* Motivation
  * different links have different **MTU** (maximum transfer unit) - the maximum amount of **data** a link-level frame can carry
  * datagram that's too large may be fragmented
* How it works
  * the router fragments the datagram into several smaller datagrams
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/xsurCLd.png)
  * the **destination** host reassembles the datagrams (note that in the middle ths datagram is **not** reassembled)
    * IP header ID, flag and offset are used to identify fragments and their order
      * ID: same as the original IP datagram
      * flag: 0 for the last segment (if not fragmented, it is naturally the last), 1 otherwise (i.e. there is a next segment)
      * offset: byte # of the **first** byte divided by **8**
      * ![](https://i.imgur.com/hnmHhfJ.png)

### Internet's IP address assignment strategy: CIDR

stands for *Classless Inter-Domain Routing*

* subnet prefix is of *arbitrary* length
  * not limited to multiples of 8
* address format: `a.b.c.d/x` where $x$ is the number of bits in subnet prefix
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/oaXUDGw.png)
* subnet mask
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/FWA7rKr.png)

### Hierarchical addressing

* enables efficient advertisement of routing information
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ard3T0V.png)
* longest prefix match
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/zy8QF2r.png)
  * in this case, what if an address matches both *net masks*?
    * forward the packet to the longest prefix match

### Network address translation (NAT)

* NAT-enabled routers must
  * Replace `(source IP address, port #)` of every **outgoing datagram to `(NAT IP address, new port #)`
  * Replace `(NAT IP address, new port #)` in destination fields of every **incoming** datagram with corresponding `(source IP address, port #)` stored in *NAT translation table*.
* NAT translation table
  * a bidirectional mapping from `(source IP, port)` to `(NAT IP, port)`
* Pros
  * one public IP for the NAT router
  * the hosts in behind the NAT is using private IP addresses - hidden from the outside world (a security plus)

## ICMP (internet control message protocol)

* ICMP messages are carried in IP datagrams
  * so only **hosts and routers** can use ICMP, as ICMP needs implementation of IP (network layer)
  * (so technically speaking a transport layer service?)
* ICMP is used by hosts and routers for
  * error report
    * `traceroute` makes use of the "TTL expired" error message
  * echo request/reply (`ping`)
* ICMP header: type + code + checksum + others

## Routing algorithms (only covers **intra-AS** routing)

* link state algorithms (non-examinable)
  * all routers have the complete knowledge of network topology and link cost
  * use Dijkstra to compute the least cost path locally (using the global view)
* distance vector algorithms
  * initially
    * routers know 1) physically-connected neighbors 2) distance to the direct neighbors
  * as the algorithm runs
    * routers exchange *local views* with neighbors and update local view of its own
  * Bellman-Ford equation
    * $c(x, y)$ means the cost between two **directly connected** node $x$ and $y$
    * $d_x(y)$ means (in $x$'s view) the shortest distance from $x$ to $y$
    * $d_x(y) = min_v({c(x,v) + d_v(y)})$ for all direct neighbor $v$ of $x$
  * RIP (routing information protocol)
    * cost = **hop count**
    * entries in the **routing table** are aggregated **subnet masks**
    * exchange routing table
      * every 30 seconds
      * via **UDP** port 520
    * "self-repair": if no update from a neighbour router for 3 minutes, assume neighbour has failed



# Lecture 8: Network security

## Principles of cryptography

* Algorithms are known to everyone
* only "key" is secret

### Symmetric key

![](https://i.imgur.com/AJJdoQV.png)

* Algorithms
  * DES(data encryption standard), AES(advanced encryption standard)
* Examples
  * mono-alphabetic cipher - substituting one letter for another
  * encryption key: mapping of 26 characters
* Issues
  * requires the sender and receiver to **share** a secret key

### Asymmetric key

![](https://i.imgur.com/I4zjwPC.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/DEqKd8l.png)

* Key pair
  * **Public** encryption key $K^+$: known to the world.
  * **Private** decryption key $K^-$: known only to receiver.
  * Given public key, it should be difficulty to find corresponding private key.
* Important property
  * $K_B^-(K_B^+(m)) = K_B^+(K_B^-(m)) = m$
  * meaning the order of applying public or private key doesn't matter
* Algorithms
  * RSA
    * public key: the product of two very large primes
    * private key: derived from that two primes
    * security relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers

### Sym + Asym in practice: Session Key

* RSA is slow and DES is fast (at least 100x)
* Use public key crypto (RSA) to establish secure connection (share session key $K_S$), then use symmetric key crypto to communicate
* Session key $K_S$:
  * Bob and Alice use RSA to exchange a symmetric key $K_S$
  * Once both have $K_S$, they use symmetric key cryptography.
  * No need to remember $K_S$, it’s valid for one session only.

## Message integrity (authentication)

* Message authentication
  * ensure a message has not been modified during transmission.
  * verify the creator of a message.
  * two techniques: message authentication code (MAC), digital signature
* Cryptographic hash functions
  * message digest / hash / fingerprint
    * let the hash function be $H$, message be $m$
    * the result of $H(m)$ is called hash
  * algorithms
    * MD5(Message Digest)and SHA-1(Secure Hash Algorithm)
  * one-way function
    * computationally infeasible to find two different `m` and `m'` such that `H(m) === H(m')`
    * once `m` is modified, `H(m)` changes as well
    * `(m, H(m))` cannot make sure that the source is legit - they can create a new pair `(m', H(m'))`
* Message authentication code (MAC)
  * a **key** is used in the message digest generation
  * standard: HMAC (RFC 2104), can be used together with *MD5* or *SHA-1*
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/zi5uWQ1.png)
  * checks the message is not corrupted and Alice is the source
* Digital signature
  * feature
    * verifiable: can verify that only Alice has signed the document
    * non-repudiation: if Bob shows the document+signature to a third party, they can also be confident that the document is signed by Alice and no one else (including Bob)
  * how it works
    * Alice signs the document using her private key $K_A^-$
      * since private key is known only to Alice, only Alice can create this digital signature
      * ![](https://i.imgur.com/KwO4iTN.png)
    * Bob verifies the signature by comparing $K_A^+(K_A^-(m))$ with $m$
      * ![](https://i.imgur.com/d3PGaIb.png)
  * comparison with MAC
    * MAC uses symmetric key crypto - Alice and Bob **share** the same key and they generate the same MAC on the same document
    * MAC cannot prove to a third party that the MAC is produced by Alice or Bob
  * MAC + digital signature = signed message digest
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/oQAh2DE.png)
* Digital certificate
  * To verify the authenticity of a public key (make sure that the person holding the corresponding private key is legit)
  * Certificate authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates.
    * A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate (e.g. a person or a Web server).
    * Certificate contains
      * owner’s information (e.g. name)
      * owner’s public key 
      * owner's public key signed by CA’s private key
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/kAJ5rhH.png)


# Lecture 9&10: The link layer

## Introduction

* **Link layer** sends datagram between adjacent nodes (hosts or routers) over a single link
  * datagram --*encapsulated*--> link-layer **frames**
* Link layer services
  * Framing
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ly9tUoE.png)
    * **note** that unlike network layer, link layer will replace the header and trailer every time a frame goes through the router
      * because network layer only uses IP (a homogeneous protocol) while a datagram may go through links with different protocols before reaching the destination
  * Link access control
    * whom to send frames at a certain time
  * Reliable delivery
  * Error detection
  * Error correction
* Implementation
  * Link layer is implemented in “adapter” (aka NIC, network interface card) or on a chip.
    * E.g., Ethernet card/chipset, 802.11 card
  * Adapters are semi-autonomous, implementing both link & physical layers

## Error detection and correction

Error detection is not 100% reliable, but larger error detection and correction (EDC) field yields better detection.

* Checmsum (used in TCP/UDP/IP)
* Parity checking
  * 0 - even number of zeros, 1 - odd number of zeros
  * single bit parity
    * detects single bit errors
  * two-dimensional bit parity
    * detects and corrects single bit errors
    * OR detects 
* CRC - cyclic redundancy check (commonly used in link layer)
  * slow, however link layer usually implements hardware acceleration
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/W2fGHdg.png)
    * `D`: data bits
    * `G`: generator of r+1 bits, agreed by sender and receiver **beforehand**
    * `R`: CRC generated, r bits
    * Sender sends `(D, R)`, in this case: 101110011
    * Receiver divides `(D, R)` by `G`
      * non-zero remainder = error detected

## Multiple access control protocols

### Two types of network links

* Point-to-point link
  * A sender and a receiver connected by a dedicated link
  * Example protocols: Point-to-Point Protocol(PPP), Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)
  * No need for multiple access control
* Broadcast link (shared medium)
  * Multiple nodes connected to a shared broadcast channel.
  * When a node transmits a frame, the channel broadcasts the frame and each other node receives a copy.
  * If two nodes transmit simultaneously
    * frames *collide* at nodes and none would be received correctly

### Multiple access protocol

* distributed algorithm that determines how nodes share channel (i.e. when a node can transmit.)
* However, coordination about channel sharing must use channel itself! (i.e. no *out-of-band* channel signaling)

#### Channel partitioning

* TDMA (time division multiple access)
  * Access to channel in “rounds”.
  * Each node gets fixed length slot (length = frame transmission time) in each round.
  * Unused slots go idle.
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y5kvvIe.png)
* FDMA (frequency divison ~)
  * Channel spectrum is divided into frequency bands.
  * Each node is assigned a fixed frequency band.
  * Unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle.

#### Taking turns

* Polling
  * master node “invites” slave nodes to transmit in turn.
  * eliminates the collisions and empty slots that plague random access protocols
  * concerns:
    * polling overhead
    * single point of failure (master node)
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/3HeGpO4.png)
* Token passing
  * control token is passed from one node to next sequentially.
  * concerns:
    * token overhead
    * single point of failure (token)
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/8KL24Nb.png)

#### Random access

Random access protocols specify
* how to detect collisions
* how to recover from collisions

* Slotted ALOHA
  * Assumptions
    * All frames are of equal size.
    * Time is divided into slots of equal length (length = time to transmit 1 frame).
    * Nodes start to transmit only at the beginning of a slot.
  * Operations
    * Listens to the channel while transmitting (collision detection).
    * if collision happens: node retransmits a frame in each subsequent slot with probability $p$ until success.
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/RXSu0M8.png)
* Unslotted (pure) ALOHA
  * When there's a fresh frame - transmit immediately
  * Higher chance of collision: frame sent at $t_0$ collides with other frames sent in $(t_0 - 1, t_0 + 1)$
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/hZpRWZN.png)
* CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)
  * Sense the channel before transmission:
    * if channel is sensed idle,transmit frame
    * if channel sensed busy, defer transmission
  * Collision may still happen
    * when two nodes sense the channel idle at the same time and start transmitting simultaneously
    * because of propagation delay (detecting collision takes time)
      * ![](https://i.imgur.com/RK5E1Hc.png)
* CSMA/CD (Collision detection)
  * When collision is detected, transmission is aborted (reducing channel wastage).
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/zv2lQdy.png)
  * Retransmit after a random amount of time
  * Minimum frame size
    * If frame size is too small, collision may happen but never detected (i.e. no transmission for garbled frame)
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/5CzvGDd.png)
    * Ethernet requires a minimum frame size of 64 bytes
* CSMA/CA (Collision avoidance)
  * Used in 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
  * Receiver needs to return ACK if a frame is received OK
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/fSt57Uc.png)

## Switched local area networks (LAN)

### Link layer addressing - MAC

* MAC address (aka physical or LAN address)
  * on every adapter/network interface card (NIC)
  * used to send/receive link layer frames
  * when an adapter receives a frame
    * if destination MAC == my MAC, extracts enclosed datagram
    * if not, discards the frame
  * typically **48 bits** (6 bytes)
    * e.g. `5C-F9-DD-E8-E3-D2`
  * burnt in NIC ROM (sometimes software settable)
* IP address vs. MAC address
  * MAC address is permanent while IP address can be dynamically allocated
  * IP is hierarchical because it needs to support routing, while MAC isn't

### Link layer addressing - address resolution protocol (ARP)

Get the MAC address of the receiving host, given its IP address.

* ARP table
  * on each IP node (host, router) - network layer node
  * `<IP address, MAC address, TLL>`
* Sending frame in the **same** subnet
  * If `A` knows `B`'s MAC address from its ARP table
    * create a frame with `B`'s MAC addresses and send it.
    * Only `B` will process this frame.
    * Other nodes may receive but will ignore this frame.
  * If `B`'s MAC address is not in `A`'s ARP table
    * Check B's IP address and see if it's in the same subnet with `A`
      * using subnet mask
    * `A` broadcasts **ARP query packet**
      * containing `B`'s IP address
      * Src MAC = `A`'s MAC address
      * Dest MAC = `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`
      * All the other nodes in the same subnet will receive this ARP query packet, but only `B` will reply it.
      * `B` replies to `A` with its MAC address, src = `A`'s MAC address
      * `A` caches `B`'s MAC address in its *ARP table*
* Sending frame to **another** subnet
  * `A` creates a frame with
    * `R`'s MAC address as destination
    * `B`'s IP address as destination
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/JJPVlMF.png)
  * `R` replaces the frame with
    * `R`'s MAC address as source
    * `B`'s MAC address as destination (by looking up its ARP table)

### Ethernet

Local area network (LAN): LAN is a computer network that interconnects computers within a geographical area such as office building or university campus.

* 802.3 Ethernet standards
  * Different physical layer protocols
  * Same link layer (MAC protocol and frame format)
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/s6qgrE8.png)
* Ethernet physical topology
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/iP4f2m7.png)
  * Bus: nodes can collide with each other
    * Star: switch in the center, nodes don't collide
* Ethernet frame format
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/crkgaNZ.png)
  * Data field (46-1500 bytes)
    * if IP datagram exceeds 1500 bytes - fragment
    * if IP datagram less than 46 bytes - fill to 46 bytes
  * Preamble
    * **7** bytes with pattern `10101010` followed by **1** byte with pattern `10101011`
    * used to synchronize receiver and sender clock rates
    * also used to wake up receivers
  * Dest/src address: MAC address, NIC discards a frame if dest doesn't match its MAC
  * Type: mostly IP
    * ARP packet will have a different type, and when the arriving frame is of type ARP, it will be **demultiplexed** to the ARP protocol (of network layer)
  * CRC: 32 bits, can detect 32-bit long single burst error (continuous error)
* Ethernet data delivery service
  * Connectionless
  * Unreliable
    * receiving NIC doesn't send ACK or NAK to sending NIC
    * different from 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
* Ethernet multiple access protocol
  * CSMA/CD
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/M8ZBAKa.png)
  * with binary exponential backoff
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/t95HLR4.png)

### Link-layer switches

* A link-layer device used in LAN
  * Store and forward Ethernet frames
    * Switch buffers frames and is full duplex
  * Examine incoming frame’s MAC address, selectively forward frame to one-or-more outgoing links.
* Transparent to hosts (and routers)
  * No IP address
  * Hosts are unaware of the presence of switches
* Switch forwarding table
  * `< MAC address of host, interface to reach host, TTL >`
  * Self-learning forwarding table
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/astl56R.png)
* Interconnecting switches
  * switches can be connected in hierarchy
  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/XHsLJg8.png)
* Switch loop (not covered)
  * the active topology of a switched network is restricted to be a **spanning tree**
    * "active topology" doesn't mean physical topology, logically spanning tree should be fine
  * otherwise the broadcast or multicast frames would be stuck in an infinite loop (broadcast storms)

**Note: **
* link-layer switches don't have link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces that connect to hosts and routers.
* link layer doesn't have TTL to prevent a frame from cycling in the network
* link layer addressing (MAC) is flat (non-hierarchical), which is different from network layer addressing (IP)

## Digital transmission

In digital transmission, we encode 0s and 1s with different voltages to be transmitted over the wire.

### NRZ (Non return to zero)

* Two voltage levels
  * NRZ-L (L for level): absolute voltage level
  * NRZ-I (I for inversion): inverts the voltage if the bit **1** is encountered
    * the first bit is hard-coded (i.e. absolute voltage level)
    * other bits are edge-detection
