# 1.3 Network core

i.e. A mesh of interconnected routers

## Circuit switching

End-to-end resources allocated and **reserved** for "call" between source and destination.

- Require setup
- Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
- No sharing: circuit segment idle if not used by call
- Divide link bandwidth into pieces by
  - frequency division
  - time division

## Packet switching

- Break message into **packets** of length $L$ bits
- transmits packets onto the link at transmission rate $R$
  - transmission rate = link capacity / bandwidth

**Note:** *transmission rate* = $L / t$ 所以单位是 bits/sec (bps)

Compared with *circuit switching*:

- The Internet is a packet switching network
- User A, B ... ’s packets **share** network resources
- Resources are used on demand
- Excessive congestion is possible (No guaranteed performance)

### Store-and-forward

i.e. **entire** packet must arrive at a router before it can be transmitted on the next link

### Routing and Addressing

*Routing algo*: how routers determine source-destination route taken by packets.

*Addressing*: each packet needs to carry source and
destination information


## Internet structure

The Internet is a **“network-of-networks”**, organized into autonomous systems (AS), each is owned by an organization.

# 1.4 Delay, Loss and Throughput in Networks

## Delay

### Four sources of packet delay

- (Nodal) processing delay
  - check bit errors
  - determine output link
  - typically < milliseconds
- Queuing delay
  - time waiting in the queue for transmission
  - depends on congestion level of router
- Transmission delay
  - $L$: packet length (bit)
  - $R$: link bandwidth (bps)
  - $D_{trans} = L / R$ (s)
- Propagation delay
  - d: length of physical link (m)
  - s: propagation speed in medium ($\approx2*10^8$ m/s)
  - $d_{prop} = d/s$ (s)

**Note:** *transmission delay* 指的是packet从第一个bit到最后一个bit全部进入link的时间，*propagation delay*指的是每一个bit从source到destination的时间

### End-to-end packet delay

i.e. the time taken for a packet to travel from source to destination

## Loss

- Queue (aka buffer) of a router has finite capacity.
- Packet arriving to full queue will be dropped (aka lost).
- Lost packet may be
  - re-transmitted by previous node
  - by source host
  - or not at all.

## Throughput

i.e. how many bits can be transmitted per unit time

- measured for **end-to-end** communication (not on a specific link, but the end result of the packet traveling through all the links)
- Link capacity (bandwidth) is meant for a specific link

# 1.5 Protocol Layers and Service Models

## Protocol **layers**

- Protocols in the Internet are logically organized into “layers” according to their purposes.
  - Each layer provides a service
  - Simple interfaces between layers
  - Hide details from each other

## Internet protocol stack

- application
- transport
- network
- link
- physical
