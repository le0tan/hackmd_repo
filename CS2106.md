# Lecture 1: Introduction to OS

## Brief history of OS

- No OS
- Batch OS
  - Execute user program (job) one at a time
  - CPU idle when performing IO
- Time-sharing OS
  - terminals
  - user job scheduling (illusion of concurrency)
  - memory management
  - **virtualization** of hardware

## Motivations of OS

- Abstraction
  - hide low level details
  - *efficiency and portability*
- Resource allocator
  - for better utilization of resources
- Control program
  - prevent errors and improper use
  - provide security and protection

## OS Structure

- Kernel mode: have complete access to all **hardware** resources
- User mode: ~limited

Ways to structure an OS:

- Monolithic
  - Pros: well understood; good performance
  - Cons: highly coupled; very complicated

- Microkernel
  - Only provides basic and essential facilities
    - Inter-process communication
    - Address space management
    - Thread management
  - Pros: robust&extendable; isolation of kernel from high level services
  - Cons: poorer performance

## Virtual machines

### Definition

- a software emulation of hardware
- virtualization of underlying hardware

Also known as **hypervisor**

- Type 1 hypervisor
  - runs directly on hardware

- Type 2 hypervisor
  - runs in host OS
